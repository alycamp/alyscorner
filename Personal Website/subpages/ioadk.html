            <h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>
            <p>Where do I even start. This wasn't my first introduction to AURORA, I had previously heard a few songs
                off of her first album <em><u><a href="amdgmaaf.html">All My Demons Greeting Me as a Friend</a></u></em> and thought, "Hey. This is 
                pretty cool.". That was around winter of 2018 while I was studying for my grade 10 business exam. It wasn't until
                summer of the next year that I listened to this album. And oh boy, was it just the beginning of something
                amazing. This entire album is beautiful in ways that I can't even describe, just shy of perfect (in comparison
                to it's <u><a href="adkoh.html">sister album</a></u> that was released the following year). It's so bright, yet so bleak at times. And overall 
                a beautiful collection of feeling (almost primal).
