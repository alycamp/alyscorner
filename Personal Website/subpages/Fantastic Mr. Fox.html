        <h2><u>Synopsis</u></h2>
        <p>"After 12 years of bucolic bliss, Mr. Fox (George Clooney) breaks a promise to his wife (Meryl Streep) and raids the farms of their human neighbors, 
            Boggis, Bunce and Bean. Giving in to his animal instincts endangers not only his marriage but also the lives of his family and their animal friends. 
            When the farmers force Mr. Fox and company deep underground, he has to resort to his natural craftiness to rise above the opposition." - <i>Rotten Tomatoes</i></p>
        <h2><u>My Thoughts</u></h2>    
        <p>I'll be honest, I was initially drawn to this movie due to the lovely animation. Of course I had heard that the movie was great, much like the rest of Wes Anderson's work,
            but I really wanted to see if it held up in terms of both storyline and visuals, and oh boy did it deliver. The brilliant stop-motion animation is different from anything
            I've seen before. All of the animals have this lovely 'rustic' sort of look to them, and they remind me a bit of the figures that my mother keeps in the kitchen. I have to say that 
            my favourite animated scene in terms of how impressive it is would have to be the scene where farmer Bean throws a hissy-fit in his trailer and absolutely trashes the place.</p>

        <p>Originally adapted from a book of the same title by Roald Dahl, Fantasic Mr. Fox tells a great story of self-discovery. It is a lovely tale with an even more lovely atmosphere,
            and the star-studded voice cast did an amazing job! In my opinion, the best character is Ash (even though I did pity him throughout). His jealousy of his supposedly perfect cousin
            Kristofferson was very relatable, as I also feel that I fly under the radar, often going unnoticed by family members. Ash eventually becomes the hero in his own way, and it encourages
            me to always be myself, even if the standards for what is superior don't match up with the best version of me.</p>
