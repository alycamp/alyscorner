        <h2><u>Synopsis</u></h2>
        <p>"Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) is an ambitious young jazz drummer, in pursuit of rising to the top of his elite music conservatory. 
            Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), an instructor known for his terrifying teaching methods, discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into the top jazz ensemble, forever changing the young man's life. 
            But Andrew's passion to achieve perfection quickly spirals into obsession, as his ruthless teacher pushes him to the brink of his ability and his sanity." - <i>Rotten Tomatoes</i></p>
        <h2><u>My Thoughts</u></h2>    
        <p>I can't remember if my father told me to watch this movie, or if I told him to watch it, but for my sake let's say it was my idea. Much like my father,
            I have a great passion for music. Although, maybe I wouldn't go as far as Andrew. This film is an amazing tale of obsession and conformism, and how
            perfection does not always pay off. Throughout the movie, I was quite terrified of Fletcher, mostly due to his vulgar language, but also due to 
            his lack of compassion, pity, empathy, really any emotion other than anger. But at the same time, he establishes himself as such a huge authority figure 
            that I feel the need to practice my music when I'm not even in the movie! The ending of this film really stuck out to me because it was the ultimate loss
            for the protaganist. Although Andrew upstaged Fletcher at his own performance, the fact that he had so much spite, enough to torture himself practicing,
            that he endured a car accident just to play for Fletcher shows that Andrew has lost his humanity. Leading up to this moment, Andrew ruined many of his
            relationships in order to become the best in Fletchers eyes, and even though he acheived that goal, the benefit did not outweigh the cost.</p>

        <p>This film features some of the most captivating cinematography and music I've ever experienced. Many of the scenes take place in performace rooms, covered in
            black padding and flooded with warm light, it brings me back to grade school. And the music... my words can't even do it justice. My first favourite track is 
            <i>Whiplash</i>, composed by Hank Levy. It's such a booming song, and I remember it was played by some seniors at my high school one year. 
            The second song that I would listen to is much more mellow, called <i>Fletcher's Song In Club</i>, composed by Justin Hurwitz (who wrote a majority of the music for the film).
            This song helped me through a LOT of reading throughout high school English class, and I love the smooth jazz vibes.</p>
